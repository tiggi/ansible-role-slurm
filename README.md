# Creates a slurm cluster

Tested with slurm versions:
 - 14.11.0
 - 14.11.3
 - 15.08.x
 - 16.05.x

Tested with these linux distributions:
 - CentOS 6
  - Only 14.11.x
 - CentOS 7
  - 15.08.x
  - 16.05.x

## Dependencies

 - https://github.com/jabl/ansible-role-pam
  - Used to configure PAM - limit access to the compute nodes
 - https://github.com/CSC-IT-Center-for-Science/ansible-role-nhc
  - Used to configure Node Health Checker

## How-To

### Initial playbook configuration

*Playbook variables:*

All variables should be defined in defaults/main.yml

All nodes run munge. Nodes which are part of the slurm\_compute host
group will additionally run slurmd. Nodes which are part of the
slurm\_service host group will additionally runs slurmctld and
slurmdbd. Nodes which are in neither of these two host groups are 
assumed to be submit hosts.

You also need to add a mysql\_slurm_password: "PASSWORD" string
somewhere. This will be used to set a password for the slurm mysql
user. See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html

To add your own nodes and queues define the slurm_nodelist and slurm_partitionlist lists.

It is possible to ru the slurmdbd on a different host than the slurmctld by changing the slurm_accounting_storage_host variable.

### Implementation

A playbook that uses this role: https://github.com/CSC-IT-Center-for-Science/fgci-ansible

### Known Issues

 - This role used to be able to build slurm rpms, distribute them and install them. This is most likely not working anymore.
